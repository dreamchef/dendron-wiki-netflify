GIven a graph, gives a minimum [[spanning tree]].
**Complexity**:  $O(e \log n)$
# Intuition
Select the minimum weight edge such that it does not create a cycle, repeat.
# Steps
1. Set T = null.  Pick an arbitrary vertex of G and put it in the tree T.
2. Add to T that edge joining a vertex a vertex of T to a vertex not in T...
3. #todo
