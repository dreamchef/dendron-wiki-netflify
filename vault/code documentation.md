# code documentation
: allows the developer and others to understand the code as quickly as possible
## Internal
- Comments
- "self-documenting" code
## External
- feature/design specification document
- "wiki" website, document repo
## key contents
- what code does to data
- meaning of variables
- functions, methods, procedures
## "self-documenting code"
*code should be written for humans*
- stucture
