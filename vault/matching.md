#combinatorics 
A set of edges with no common vertices
# Special cases
- [[Perfect matching]]: saturates all vertices in the graph
- Maximum-cardinality matching: 
- Minimum-weight matching
# Statements
- A maximum matching is...
- [[vertex cover]] correspondence: If K is any [[vertex cover]] and M is any [[matching]], then |M| $\leq$ |K| (K is a set of vertices and M is a set of edges).
