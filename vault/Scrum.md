#software-development #paradigm 

framework for managing a process consisting of principles and practices

# Philosophical principles
1. User stories: As a *user type*, I want to *action* so that *goal*
2. Feature: service that fulfills a req/functionality
3. Product backlog: prioritized list of user requirements used to choose work to be done in project
	1. Continuously prioritized
	2. Continuously granularized
	3. Several high-priority items worked on at a given time

# Human organization
1. Sprint Team: small group of developers, usually 5-9 people; no roles or titles
2. Scrum master: coach/project manager of sprint team
3. Product owner: maintains backlog list, prioritzes work, provides guidance and vision on what to build

# Practices
## Sprint: 
- time-controlled mini-project that implements a specific portion of the system
- Max 30 days
- Commit to work, do all, only that
- Can take new work if entire team agrees
### Phases
1. Planning
2. Daily standups throughout
3. Grooming
4. Review (with release)
5. Retrospective
### Backlog 
taken from the top of the product backlog
## Grooming
Revise backlog

# Backlog
A prioritized "stack" made up of epics and stories (subdivisions of epics).  
- Top-priority items (top of the stack), are planned and sprintable because they are highly granular.  They can be actions, constraints, increments, dependencies, and desirements.
- Mid-stack items are less granular, but still somewhat refined and well-understood.  They can be desirements, opportunities, functionalities, depencies, and options.
- Bottom-stack items are general intentions, hopes and dreams.  They can be ideas or options.
