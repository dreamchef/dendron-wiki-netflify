#combinatorics  #concept 
1. An [[alternating path]] in which both of its end vertices are unsaturated by matching M. This implies the two end edges are not in M, and then path cannot be extended to a longer alternating path.
2. simple path from source (to sink) which does not include any cycles and that pass only through positive weighted edges
