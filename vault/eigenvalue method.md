#linear-algebra #method
method for solving a system of differential equations
# Steps
1. Find the [[Eigenvalue]]s of the matrix (solve the [[characteristic equation]])
2. Step 1 results in one of the following three cases
	1. Distinct real eigenvalues
	2. Repeated (multiple) real eigenvalues
	3. Complex eigenvalues
