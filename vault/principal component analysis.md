#linear-algebra #paradigm #todo 
means of dimensionality reduction
- [[covariance]]
- [[variance]]

# Method1 
1. Find the [[covariance matrix]]
2. Find the eigensystem of that matrix
3. The [[eigenvectors]] are the principal components

# Method2
1. Find covariance matrix
2. use least-squares approximation???
