# continuous integration
:[[Agile development]] practice where the system is integrated and built several times a day, and every time a task is completed
At regular intervals...
1. Integrated
2. built
3. compiled in executable
4. tested
5. archived and versions
6. deployed
7. loaded into [[development environment]]

## advantages
- lest you know the status of the full system at all times
- testing is guaranteed, no separate phase 
- increases chance of catching defects early and improving the quality and timeliness of the product
- automates deployment, always deployable
- immediate bug detection
## best practices
1. maintain a single source repository
2. automate the build
3. make your build self-testing
## tools
- [[Jenkins]]
- [[Travis CI]]
- Drone
