#algorithms #combinatorics 
formula reducing later values of a sequence to earlier ones, with an initial condition
# Solution methods
One recurrence relation may have many closed formulas, but initial conditions restrict these possible solutions.
## Iteration
#todo
## Substitution-Induction Method
1. Identify primary operation and find recurrence equation
2. Use substitution to identify possible closed form (Excel is great for this)
3. Use [[induction]] to prove closed form
## Characteristic Equation Method
#q Can be used for linear equations?
0. Eliminate right-hand term if non-homogeneous
1. Write [[characteristic equation]]
2. Find roots and their [[multiplicity]]
3. Write general closed form
4. Apply initial conditions to solve for constants
## Using [[generating function]]
1. Multiply by $x^k$
2. Take infinite sum
