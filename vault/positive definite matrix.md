#linear-algebra #concept 

a [[symmetric]] matrix with positive [[Eigenvalue]]s

see Strang p352 for TFAE
# Test
a 2 by 2 matrix $S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	a & b \\
	c & d \\
\end{bmatrix}$ is positive definite if $a > 0$ and $ac - b^2 > 0$

**semidefinite** 
- includes the possibility that the difference = 0 
- (and [[determinant]] is 0) 
- zeros along main diagonal
