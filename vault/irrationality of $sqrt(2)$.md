# Irrationality of $\sqrt(2)$
Assume that $\frac{p}{q} = \sqrt{2}$ for some $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$, and that $p$ and $q$ have no common factor (otherwise we could find another $p$ and $q$ where the equation holds). It follows:
$$\frac{p^2}{q^2} = 2 \tag{1}$$
$$p^2 = 2 q^2 \tag{2}$$
Because $q$ is an integer, $q^2$ is an integer; and therefore $p^2$ is even.  Furthermore, $p$ must be even, otherwise $p^2$ would be odd.
$$p = 2 r, r \in \mathbb{Z} \tag{3}$$
Substituting $r$ for $p$ in equation (2):
$$4 r^2 = 2 q^2 \tag{4}$$
$$2 r^2 = q^2 \tag{5}$$
It follows that $q^2$ and $q$ are even.  But if $q$ and $p$ are even, they have the common factor 2, which contradicts our previous assumption.
