$X^{-1}AX = \Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ has the [[Eigenvalue]]s of $A$ along its diagonal and $X$ is the [[Eigenvector]] matrix.

Note that in this case $\Lambda$ is similar to $A$.

# Sufficient conditions for diagonalizability
- n by n matrix A has n distinct Eigenvalues.
- A has $n$ linearly independent Eigenvectors
- X is [[invertible]]

# Diagonalizing powers of A
$A^k = X\Lambda^kX^{-1}$ and the Eigenvectors are unchanged.
The Eigenvalues are $\lambda_1^k, ..., \lambda_n^k$ in the matrix $\Lambda^k$

# Solving...
