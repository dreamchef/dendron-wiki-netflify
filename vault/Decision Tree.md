- Decision nodes and costs
# Solving the tree
*Right to left*
## Making decisions
1. List all outcomes going left from decision node.
2. Calculate [[expected value]] of each: probabilities of outcomes multiplied by payouts
3. When calculating EV, use best decisions  
# Expected Value of Sample Information
EV of best decision with sample information AT NO COST - EV without sample information
