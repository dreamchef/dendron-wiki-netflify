#analysis #definition 
# Cauchy sequence
: (of a [[sequence]] $(a_n)$), for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $A \in \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $m,n \geq N$ it follows that $|a_n - a_m| < \epsilon$
## properties
1. Every [[converge]]nt [[sequence]] is a Cauchy sequence
2. [[bounded]]
3. can be represented in [[rational number]]s for the purpose of [[computation]]
