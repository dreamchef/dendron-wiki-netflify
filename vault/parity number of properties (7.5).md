#combinatorics #theorem 
If there are $r$ properties, the number of objects have an even number of the properties is given by
$$e_0 + e_2 + e_4 + ... = \frac{1}{2}[s_0 + \sum_{t=0}^r (-2)^t s_t] = \frac{1}{2}[4^k + 2^k]$$

and ... odd ...
$$e_1 + e_3 + e_5 + ... = \frac{1}{2}[s_0 - \sum_{t=0}^r (-2)^t s_t]$$
